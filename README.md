#Project Title: Forest-Fire-Prediction

#Overview
Although forest fires or wildfires are a natural occurrence within some forest ecosystem, fire seasons are becoming more extreme and widespread, even in typical rainforests where fires are atypical and very damaging once started. Hotter, drier weather caused by climate change and poor land management create conditions favorable for more frequent, larger and higher-intensity wildfires.
Climate change and forest degradation and fragmentation have led to more fire-prone conditions globally. With hotter and drier conditions, fires - either ignited by humans or by lightning - are more likely to burn over larger areas and at hotter temperatures.
